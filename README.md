<h1>Full Contact List</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I recently had the opportunity to work on a project involving the creation of a comprehensive contact list for students at Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYUi), Ensign College, and BYU-Pathway Worldwide using Power BI. This initiative aimed to streamline communication and improve access to student information across these three institutions. To accomplish this task, I started by collecting vast amounts of data from various sources such as the universities' databases and online directories. Subsequently, I meticulously cleaned and structured the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Power BI, I then designed an interactive dashboard that allowed users to easily search for specific students and retrieve their contact details promptly. This project not only enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing among administrators, faculty, and staff but also provided a valuable tool for efficiently connecting with students across all three campuses for various academic and administrative purposes. A complete full contact list also included geographical areas where these students come from, countries, states, student's school IDs, scholarships, and their mentors.

I regret to inform you that I'm unable to post my project on this platform due to specific circumstances. As a professional in this field, I recognize the importance of privacy and discretion when it comes to sensitive information or proprietary projects. Hence, to ensure the confidentiality and security of my work, I have chosen not to publicly share it. Confidentiality is paramount in maintaining trust with clients and protecting their intellectual property rights. Therefore, I propose conducting this project privately through secure channels that can accommodate our needs while upholding confidentiality as a top priority. By doing so, we can guarantee the utmost privacy and establish an environment conducive to open collaboration without risking exposure of our work. Please rest assured that the decision to proceed privately aligns with industry standards and best practices, underscoring my commitment to professionalism and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all aspects of my work. <br/>_
